Im standing at the road,
(You know The one that diverges) 
its In a wood glen, a big bend
full of cravings and urges

so Im here with my two hands 
And My one God, my one fam
and they’re patting my back 
Telling me to react
Telling me to go head
Before it all cuts to black

I don’t need some new sneakers
To give my brain satisfaction
I will listen to speakers
Turn my thoughts into action

I will put forth the work
Bring the fruits for a change
Turn my life on a dime
Wash away any shame

I need some time with myself, not the time on my phone
I need some heavenly wealth, I’ll find my heavenly home

I’ll walk the path of belief, and this time I won’t stray
So here I am holding on to every word that you say
To every word that you’ve said, and every word that you’ll say

I’ll stop chasing the checks
and start chasing the _way_
Ill keep living the _truth_
and I will every day

That’s called living the /life, /
and I like how it sounds
Battle through all the strife
keep my feet on the ground

My mom has always given me just two points of advice
suck it up then love em all, And avoid any vice
so
Don’t let the dark in, you gotta let the light stay
Don’t let your thoughts win, you gotta Choose The Right way

I know it all seems cloudy
I know it all seems lost
I know you’ve been kinda pouty
I know it came at a cost

Know This road will go somewhere
But the other goes another
And I like your blonde hair
but im sorry about your lover

we’re all standing at a road,
At a fork, at a cross
And we decide what we want
either way there’s a cost

so I think ill go higher
Less traveled with the saints
Maybe ill get my desire
If I do I might faint 

so Im here with my two hands 
And My true God, my true fam
and they’re patting my back 
Telling me to react
Telling me to go head,
Before it all cuts to black
